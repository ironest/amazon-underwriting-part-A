# Amazon Underwriting - Part A

## R1 - Description

Our project revolves around the **Amazon Underwriting Pty Ltd** business; they are a privately owned underwriting agency focussed on delivering insurance packages tailored for specific niche markets.

### Purpose

Create a website to be used as a landing page in order to advertise **Amazon Underwriting PTY Ltd** on the internet with a more modern UI/UX. Along with improvements to its functionality/usability with a simple to use admin-only page that gives the owner an easy way to update parts of the website they may need to update regularly.

The purpose of this project has **two objectives**:
1. Rebuilding the current production-live version of the [Amazon-Underwriting](https://amazonunderwriting.com.au/) website to give it a newer/fresher design and a smoother user experience.
2. Creating a parallel web-app to be used as an admin-panel through which the business owner can autonomously manage content and media of the public website.

### Functionality 

* Database provisioning
* Collection of user contact details
